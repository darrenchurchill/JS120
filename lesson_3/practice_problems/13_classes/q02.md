# JS120 Lesson 3

## Practice Problems: Assignment 13: Classes

### Question 2

Consider the following class declaration:

```js
class Television {
  static manufacturer() {
    // omitted code
  }

  model() {
    // method logic
  }
}
```

What does the `static` modifier do? How would we call the method `manufacturer`?

### Solution

The `static` modifier to a `class` method declaration defines the method as a
static method. Static methods are methods of the class constructor, and do not
require an instance object to be called. They are called as methods of the
constructor object.

In the example above, you would call the `manufacturer`
method using the syntax: `Television.manufacturer()`.
