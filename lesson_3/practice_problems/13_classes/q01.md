# JS120 Lesson 3

## Practice Problems: Assignment 13: Classes

### Question 1

What do we mean when we say that classes are first-class values?

### Solution

A first-class value is a type of value that can be:

- assigned to a variable
- passed as an argument to a function
- returned by a function

Class definitions using the `class` keyword in JavaScript are just `function`s,
which are themselves first-class values. Therefore, classes are also first-class
values in JavaScript.
