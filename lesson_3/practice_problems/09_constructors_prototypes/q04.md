# JS120 Lesson 3

## Practice Problems: Assignment 9: Constructors and Prototypes

### Question 4

What will the following code log to the console and why?

```js
function Ninja() {
  this.swung = true;
}

let ninja = new Ninja();

Ninja.prototype.swingSword = function() {
  return this.swung;
};

console.log(ninja.swingSword());
```

### Solution

In this example, `swingSword` is defined as a method on the `Ninja`
constructor's prototype. The variable `ninja` is declared and initialized as
as new object of type `Ninja`. Therefore, when `ninja.swingSword` is invoked,
JavaScript looks up the prototype chain for `ninja`'s `swingSword` method, and
finds it in the object's `prototype`. `swingSword` is called as a method, so
`this` is bound to the calling object, `ninja`, and the method returns
`ninja.swung`, `true`. This value is logged to the console.
