# JS120 Lesson 3

## Practice Problems: Assignment 9: Constructors and Prototypes

### Question 1

What does the following code log to the console? Try to answer without running
the code. Can you explain why the code produces the output it does?

```js
let RECTANGLE = {
  area: function() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  },
  perimeter: function() {
    return 2 * (this.width + this.height);
  },
};

function Rectangle(width, height) {
  this.width = width;
  this.height = height;
  this.area = RECTANGLE.area();
  this.perimeter = RECTANGLE.perimeter();
}

let rect1 = new Rectangle(2, 3);

console.log(rect1.area);
console.log(rect1.perimeter);
```

### Solution

In the code above, `rect1` is declared and initialized on line 17 to be a new
`Rectangle` instance. The object returned by calling the `Rectangle` constructor
has `area` and `perimeter` properties, which are assigned the values returned by
invoking the `RECTANGLE` object's `area` and `permimeter` methods, respectively.
These are invoked as methods of `RECTANGLE`, so `this` is implicitly bound to
the `RECTANGLE` object when they're invoked inside of `Rectangle()`. `RECTANGLE`
doesn't have `width` or `height` properties, so each of these methods returns
`NaN`, because they perform mathematical operations on `undefined` values.

Therefore, line 19 and line 20 both log `NaN` to the console.
