# JS120 Lesson 3

## Practice Problems: Assignment 9: Constructors and Prototypes

### Question 5

What will the following code output and why? Try to answer without running the code.

```js
function Ninja() {
  this.swung = true;
}

let ninja = new Ninja();

Ninja.prototype = {
  swingSword: function() {
    return this.swung;
  },
};

console.log(ninja.swingSword());
```

### Solution

This example is slightly different from the previous problem. Here, the `Ninja`
constructor's prototype object is reassigned to reference a new object with
a `swingSword` method. Initially, before this reassignment, `ninja`'s prototype
and `Ninja`'s prototype reference the same object, which doesn't have a
`swingSword` method. After `Ninja.prototype` is reassigned to the new object,
`Ninja.prototype` and `ninja`'s prototype no longer reference the same object.

Therefore, when `ninja.swingSword()` is invoked on line 13, JavaScript can't
find a `swingSword` method, and will throw a `TypeError`.
