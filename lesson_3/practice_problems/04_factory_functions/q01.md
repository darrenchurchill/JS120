## Practice Problems: Assignment 4: Factory Functions

### Question 1

What are two disadvantages of working with factory functions?

### Solution

Two disadvantages of working with factory functions to create objects are:

1. Every object has its own copies of properties and methods that are common to
   all of those "type" of object. This is redundant, and can strain resources at
   the extreme.
2. There is no way to identify an object's type if it's been generated by a
   factory function. This makes it impossible to be sure you're working with or
   have been given the correct type of object.
