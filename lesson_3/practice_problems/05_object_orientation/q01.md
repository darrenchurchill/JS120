# JS120 Lesson 3

## Practice Problems: Assignment 6: Object Orientation

### Question 1

Suppose we want to use code to keep track of products in our hardware store's
inventory. A first stab might look something like this:

```js
let scissorsId = 0;
let scissorsName = 'Scissors';
let scissorsStock = 8;
let scissorsPrice = 10;

let drillId = 1;
let drillName = 'Cordless Drill';
let drillStock = 15;
let drillPrice = 45;
```

This code presents a number of problems, however. What if we want to add another
kind of drill? Given what we've learned about object orientation in the previous
assignment, how could we use objects to organize these two groups of data?

### Solution

These two groups of data represent a different product. You could create an
object to represent these bundles of information and keep them together. For
example:

```js
let scissors = {
  id: 0,
  name: "Scissors",
  stock: 8,
  price: 10,
};

let drill = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Cordless Drill",
  stock: 15,
  price: 45,
};
```
