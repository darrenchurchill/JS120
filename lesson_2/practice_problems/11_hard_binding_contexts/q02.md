# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 11: Hard Binding Functions with Contexts

### Question 2

What will the following code log to the console?

```js
let obj = {
  message: 'JavaScript',
};

function foo() {
  console.log(this.message);
}

foo.bind(obj);
```

### Solution

The code will not log anything to the console. On line 9, `foo.bind(obj)`
returns a new function that when called has its execution context bound to
`obj`. `bind` doesn't invoke the function, however, so the statements inside
`foo()` don't execute.
