## Practice Problems: Assignment 11: Hard Binding Functions with Contexts

### Question 4

What will the code below log to the console?

```js
let positivity = {
  message: 'JavaScript makes sense!',
};

let negativity = {
  message: 'JavaScript makes no sense!',
};

function foo() {
  console.log(this.message);
}

let bar = foo.bind(positivity);

negativity.logMessage = bar;
negativity.logMessage();
```

### Solution

On line 13, `bar` is declared and initialized to `foo.bind(positivity)`'s return
value. This is a function equivalent to `foo()` whose execution context is
permanently bound to the `positivity` object. The new function doesn't execute,
however, so setting `negativity`'s `logMessage` property equal to `bar` assigns
it with a reference to this *permanently* bound function.

Invoking the bound function using the reference stored in
`negativity.logMessage` still uses the context set on line 13, the `positivity`
object, so `this` is assigned a reference to the `positivity` object, and
`positivity.message`, `'JavaScript makes sense!'` is logged to the console.
