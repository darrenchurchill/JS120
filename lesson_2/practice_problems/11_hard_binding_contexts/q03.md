# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 11: Hard Binding Functions with Contexts

### Question 3

What will the following code output?

```js
let obj = {
  a: 2,
  b: 3,
};

function foo() {
  return this.a + this.b;
}

let bar = foo.bind(obj);

console.log(foo());
console.log(bar());
```

### Solution

On line 10, `bar` is declared and initialized with a reference to `foo.bind(obj)`'s
return value. This is a new function, equivalent to `foo` except that it's `this`
context has been permanently bound to the `obj` object. Invoking `bar` will be
as though `bar` is a method of `obj`.

Invoking `foo()` on line 12 uses the implicit global execution context, and the
global object doesn't have an `a` or `b` property, so it will return the value
`undefined + undefined`, which is `NaN`. Invoking `bar()` on line 13 uses its
previously bound context, so `this` will have a reference to the `obj` object.
`this.a + this.b` in this context returns `2 + 3`, `5`, and that value is logged
to the console.

**Note:** If you run the example above in strict mode, calling `foo()`
implicitly sets `this` to undefined, instead of the global object, causing
`this.a` to raise a `TypeError`.
