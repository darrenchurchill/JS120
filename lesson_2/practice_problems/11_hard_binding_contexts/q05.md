# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 11: Hard Binding Functions with Contexts

### Question 5

What will the code below output?

```js
let obj = {
  a: 'Amazebulous!',
};
let otherObj = {
  a: "That's not a real word!",
};

function foo() {
  console.log(this.a);
}

let bar = foo.bind(obj);

bar.call(otherObj);
```

### Solution

On line 12, `bar` is declared an initialized with a reference to
`foo.bind(obj)`'s return value. This is a function, equivalent to `foo`, whose
execution context is *permanently* bound to the `obj` object.

You cannot call the `bar` function using another context, so when it is invoked
on line 14 using the `call` method seemingly to set the execution context to the
`otherObj` obj, the context remains set to the `obj` object. Therefore, `this`
is bound to the `obj` object, and invoking `bar` on line 14 logs `obj.a`,
`'Amazebulous!'` to the console.
