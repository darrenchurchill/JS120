# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 4: Object Prototypes

### Question 6

How do you create an object that doesn't have a prototype? How can you determine
whether an object has a prototype?

### Solution

By default, all object's in JavaScript inherit from the `Object.prototype`
prototype object. You can create an object that doesn't include
`Object.prototype` in its prototype chain by explicitly setting its `prototype`
property to `null`.

For example:

```js
let obj = Object.create(null)
```

In the example above, `obj` is created using `Object.create`, given the argument
`null`, which returns an object that inherits from `null`, or has no prototype
object.

You can determine whether an object has a prototype by using the
`Object.getPrototypeOf()` static method. This method takes an object argument
and returns a reference to that object's prototype. The method returns `null` if
the object doesn't have a prototype.
