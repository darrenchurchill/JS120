# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 4: Object Prototypes

### Question 3

What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value.
Try to answer without running the code.

```js
let qux = { foo: 1 };
let baz = Object.create(qux);
qux.foo = 2;

console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
```

### Solution

In this example, `baz` inherits from `qux`, and `qux`'s own `foo` property is
reassigned the value `2` on line 3. On line 5, `baz` doesn't have its own `foo`
property, so JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find `qux`'s `foo`
property, which is now `2`. Therefore, `2 + 2`, `4` is logged to the console on
line 5.
