# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 4: Object Prototypes

### Question 2

What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value.
Try to answer without running the code.

```js
let qux = { foo: 1 };
let baz = Object.create(qux);
baz.foo = 2;

console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
```

### Solution

In this example, `baz` is declared and initialized on line 2 to inherit from
`qux`. `baz` initially inherits its `foo` property from `qux`, but on line 3,
`baz`'s own `foo` property is assigned the value `2`. Therefore, on line 5, the
values of `baz`'s `foo` property, `2`, and `quz`'s `foo` property, `1` are used
in the expression, so `3` is logged to the console.
