# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 4: Object Prototypes

### Question 1

What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value.
Try to answer without running the code.

```js
let qux = { foo: 1 };
let baz = Object.create(qux);
console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
```

### Solution

On line 1, `qux` is declared and initialized as a reference to the object with 1
property, `foo`, whose value is `1`. On line 2, `baz` is declared and
initialized as a reference to `Object.create(qux)`'s return value, a new object
whose prototype is `qux`.

Line 3 logs the result of adding `baz`'s and `qux`'s `foo` properties. `qux` has
its own `foo` property with value `1`. `baz` doesn't have its own `foo`
property, but it inherits from `qux`, which has a `foo` property. Therefore,
line 3, logs `2` to the console.
