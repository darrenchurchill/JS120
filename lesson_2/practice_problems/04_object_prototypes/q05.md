# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 4: Object Prototypes

### Question 5

Consider the following two loops:

```js
for (let property in foo) {
  console.log(`${property}: ${foo[property]}`);
}
```

```js
Object.keys(foo).forEach(property => {
  console.log(`${property}: ${foo[property]}`);
});
```

If `foo` is an arbitrary object, will these loops always log the same results to
the console. Explain why they do or do not. If they don't always log the same
information, show an example of when the results differ.

### Solution

The first loop above uses a `for...in` statement, which iterates over all of an
object's enumerable string properties, including inherited enumerable
properties. The second loop above uses `Object.keys()` to get an array of the
object's own enumerable string-keyed property names, and then iterates over that
array using the `forEach()` method.

The first loop will log inherited enumerable properties to the console; the
second loop will not. Therefore, the loops will only output the same results
when `foo`'s prototype chain doesn't contain any enumerable properties.

For example:

```js
let proto = { name: "prototype" };
let foo = Object.create(proto);
```

If `foo` was defined to inherit from the `proto` object as above, the first loop
would log `"name: prototype"` to the console. The second loop would not.
