# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 15: Dealing with Context Loss

### Question 4

Consider the following code:

```js
const TESgames = {
  titles: ['Arena', 'Daggerfall', 'Morrowind', 'Oblivion', 'Skyrim'],
  seriesTitle: 'The Elder Scrolls',
  listGames: function() {
    this.titles.forEach(function(title) {
      console.log(this.seriesTitle + ': ' + title);
    });
  }
};

TESgames.listGames();
```

Will this code produce the following output? Why or why not?

```plain
The Elder Scrolls: Arena
The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall
The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind
The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion
The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim
```

### Solution

The code above will not produce the desired output. Functions lose their
surrounding context when they're used as arguments to another function. In this
example, the function that loses its surrounding context is the anonymous
callback passed to `forEach`.

`listGames` is called as a method on line 11, so `this` is initially bound to
the `TESgames` object during its execution. Within `listGames`, `forEach` is
called as a method of `TESgames.titles`, so during its execution, `this` is
bound to the `titles` array. However, during each of `forEach`'s iterations, the
anonymous callback function is invoked in the global execution context, so
`this` is bound to the global object for the callback execution. The global
object doesn't have a `seriesTitle` property, so `forEach`'s callback logs:

```plain
undefined: Arena
undefined: Daggerfall
undefined: Morrowind
undefined: Oblivion
undefined: Skyrim
```
