## Practice Problems: Assignment 15: Dealing with Context Loss

### Question 1

The code below should output `"Christopher Turk is a Surgeon"`. Without running
the code, what will it output? If there is a difference between the actual and
desired output, explain the difference.

```js
let turk = {
  firstName: 'Christopher',
  lastName: 'Turk',
  occupation: 'Surgeon',
  getDescription() {
      return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName + ' is a '
                                  + this.occupation + '.';
  }
};

function logReturnVal(func) {
  let returnVal = func();
  console.log(returnVal);
}

logReturnVal(turk.getDescription);
```

### Solution

The desired output is to log the `turk` object's `firstName`, `lastName`, and
`occupation` properties using the `getDescription` method. Because `this` is
bound to the global object at invocation, this isn't the output you actually
get.

The function `logReturnVal` takes 1 argument, a reference to a function, and
invokes that function in the first statement on line 12. `logReturnVal` is
invoked on line 16 in the implicit global context, so `this` gets bound to the
global object.

`logReturnVal`'s argument is a reference to the `turk.getDescription` method, so
that function's statements execute when `func` is called on line 12. Because
`this` is bound to the global object, and the global object has no `firstName`,
`lastName`, or `occupation` properties, its return value is `"undefined
undefined is a undefined."` This string is logged to the console on line 13
before `logReturnVal` returns on line 16.
