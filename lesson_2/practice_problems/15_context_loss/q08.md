# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 15: Dealing with Context Loss

### Question 8

Consider the following code:

```js
let foo = {
  a: 0,
  incrementA: function() {
    function increment() {
      this.a += 1;
    }

    increment();
  }
};

foo.incrementA();
foo.incrementA();
foo.incrementA();
```

What will the value of `foo.a` be after this code runs?

### Solution

The code above invokes `foo`'s `incrementA` method 3 times. This method defines
a function, `increment` that increment's the `this` object's `a` property, and
invokes that function in the global execution context before returning.

Because `incrementA`'s `increment` function is called as a function in the
global context, `this` is bound to the global object, which in this example
doesn't initially have an `a` property.  Attempting to increment a object's
property that doesn't exist will assign the value `NaN` to the property. After
the first invocation of `foo.incrementA()`, the global object has an `a`
property with value `NaN`. The remaining two invocations of `foo.incrementA()`
increment the global object's `a` property, which will remain `NaN`.
