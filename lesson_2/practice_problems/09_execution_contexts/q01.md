# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 9: Implicit and Explicit Function Execution Contexts

### Question 1

What will the following code output? Try to determine the results without
running the code.

```js
function func() {
  return this;
}

let context = func();

console.log(context);
```

### Solution

In this example, `func` is called with an implicit function execution context,
so JavaScript binds `this` to the global object when it is called on line 5.
Invoking `func` in the global context returns a reference to the global object,
and `context` is assigned this reference. Therefore, the global object is logged
to the console on line 7.
