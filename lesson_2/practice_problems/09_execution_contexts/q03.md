# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 9: Implicit and Explicit Function Execution Contexts

### Question 3

What will the following code output?

```js
message = 'Hello from the global scope!';

function deliverMessage() {
  console.log(this.message);
}

deliverMessage();

let foo = {
  message: 'Hello from the function scope!',
};

foo.deliverMessage = deliverMessage;

foo.deliverMessage();
```

### Solution

In this example, the function `deliverMessage` references is called in two
different execution contexts, logging two different values of `message` to the
console.

First, the global variable `message` is declared without using `let`, `var`, or
`const`, so JavaScript sets the `message` property on the global object.
`deliverMessage()` is defined to log the `this` object's `message` property to
the console. When `deliverMessage()` is invoked on line 7 in the global function
execution context, `this` is bound to the global object, and the function logs
`global.message`, `'Hello from the global scope!'` to the console.

Second, the variable `foo` is declared and initialized with a reference to the
object with a `message` property, `'Hello from the function scope!'`. `foo`'s
`deliverMessage` property is assigned a reference to the `deliverMessage()`
global function, and the method is called in the implicit method context. The
method context binds `this` to the `foo` object, and the method call logs
`foo`'s `message` value to the console, `'Hello from the function scope!'`.
