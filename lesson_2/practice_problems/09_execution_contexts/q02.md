# JS120 Lesson 2

## Practice Problems: Assignment 9: Implicit and Explicit Function Execution Contexts

### Question 2

What will the following code output? Explain the difference, if any, between
this output and that of problem 1.

```js
let obj = {
  function func() {
    return this;
  },
};

let context = obj.func();

console.log(context);
```

### Solution

In this example, `func` is called with an implicit method execution context, so
JavaScript binds `this` to the calling object, `obj`, when it is called on line 5.
Invoking `func` in this context returns a reference to the calling object, and
`context` is assigned this reference. Therefore, the object `obj` references is
logged to the console on line 7.
