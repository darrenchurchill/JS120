# JS120 Lesson 4

## Practice Problems: Assignment 8: Code Reuse with Mixins

### Question 2

In the last question, we used a mix-in named `Speed` that contained a `goFast`
method. We included the mix-in in the `Car` class and then called the `goFast`
method from an instance of the `Car` class. You may have noticed that the string
printed when we call `goFast` includes the name of the type of vehicle we are
using. How is that done?

### Solution

The `goFast` method logs the calling object's constructor function's name in
its log statement. This is done using the `name` property all `Function`s have,
which is a string indicating the function's name as specified at creation.

In the case of the `car` and `truck` objects, their constructor functions are
`Car` and `Truck`, respectively, so `car.constructor.name` is `"Car"` and
`truck.constructor.name` is `"Truck"`.
