# JS120 Lesson 4

## Practice Problems: Assignment 6: Subtyping with Classes

### Question 1

Suppose we have the following classes:

```js
class Game {
  play() {
    return 'Start the game!';
  }
}

class Bingo extends Game {
  rulesOfPlay() {
    // rules of play
  }
}
```

What would happen if we added a `play` method to the `Bingo` class, keeping in
mind that there is already a method of this name in the `Game` class from which
the `Bingo` class inherits? Explain your answer. What do we call it when we
define a method like this?

### Solution

The `Bingo` class inherits from the `Game` class, but doesn't have its own
`play` method. Therefore, if `play` is called on an instance of `Bingo`, JavaScript
will look up the prototype chain to find `Game`'s `play` method to use.

If we were to add a `play` method to `Bingo`, JavaScript would instead use this
version of `play` when invoked on an object of type `Bingo`. This is called
overriding a method.
