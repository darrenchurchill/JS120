## Practice Problems: Assignment 3: Object Creation with Prototypes

### Question 3

Consider the objects created by the programs in problems 1 and 2. How do objects
for the same animal differ from each other?

#### Problem 1

```js
function createPet(animal, name) {
  return {
    animal,
    name,

    sleep() {
      console.log("I am sleeping");
    },

    wake() {
      console.log("I am awake");
    },
  };
}
```

#### Problem 2

```js
let petPrototype = {
  init(animal, name) {
    this.animal = animal;
    this.name = name;
    return this;
  },

  sleep() {
    console.log("I am sleeping");
  },

  wake() {
    console.log("I am awake");
  },
};
```

### Solution

In problem 1, the `createPet` factory function returns an object with its own
`sleep` and `wake` methods. In problem 2, using the OLOO pattern, the `sleep`
and `wake` methods are defined as methods of the `petPrototype` object, which
each pet instance inherits from. Therefore, in problem 2, all the pet objects
share references to the same `sleep` and `wake` methods.
